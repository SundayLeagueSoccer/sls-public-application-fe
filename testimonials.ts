      "My Sls experience has been nothing but incredible. Given the opportunity to join the family and school the boys on how to be a top tier striker has been a privilege. I hope to continue terrorizing them all. As for my critic : officiating needs to be worked on.",

    statement:
      "Growing up, recreation was an everyday activity. Football, hanging out with friends etc. are memories that I cherish from my adolescent days. As an Adult/youth, these activities have had a drastic decline and activities such as football became an occasional affair. SLS is a community that helps me relive those memories while staying in shape. Thank you Oyehdayg for introducing me to this community.",

I definitely hope to see the league get better  in all… ",

    statement:
      "SLS started because a small group of boys wanted to convey, reconnect and catch some fun at least once a week, but boy, we’ve done above and beyond that.  We reconnect with old friends, meet new ones, keep fit and most importantly HAVE FUN.  Now, you get angry when/if you miss a day. It’s become a part of our lives, it’s become a culture.",
